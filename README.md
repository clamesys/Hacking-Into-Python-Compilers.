# Hacking-Into-Python-Compilers.
Just run this code to Run any remote command into the compiler machine.

Install the requirements.txt using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Replace the URCOMMAND with the command based on the machine u are attacking.

Use OS1.py on an non-input support compiler

Use OS2.py on an input supporting compiler.

Hope It Helps :)
