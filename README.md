# Hacking-Into-Python-Compilers.
Just run this code to Run any remote command into the cpmpiler machine.

install the requirements.txt using **how**

replace the URCOMMAND with the command based on the machine u are attacking.

use OS1.py on an non-input support compiler

use OS2.py on an input supporting compiler.

Hope It Helps :)
